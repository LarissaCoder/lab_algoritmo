    <h1>Summer Flowers</h1>
        <p>One of the most iconic summer flowers is the sunflower. With its bright yellow petals and large, round center, the sunflower is a symbol of sunshine and happiness. Standing tall and proud in fields and gardens, it embodies the spirit of summer.
        Roses, with their rich and varied colors, also thrive during the summer months. Whether it's the classic red roses, the soft pink blooms, or the vibrant orange hues, roses add elegance and romance to any summer garden.
        Other summer flowers include the cheerful daisies, the fragrant lavender, and the vibrant gerbera daisies. Each brings its own unique charm and beauty to the summer landscape.</p>
